# FPM Repo

Here's code I've used several times and will probably use again. I'm putting it on github for the following reasons:

1. If it could help somebody solve a problem, that would be rad.

1. It will keep me honest, with respect to documenting my code well.

## ML : Machine Learning

### NeuralNets

### RandomForests

## XY : Graphing

# TODO
